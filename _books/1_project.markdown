“Aaron McCollough has reclaimed (that is, radically reclaimed) a certain ancientness of praise and quest, credence and address, for our fractured present. The resulting poems resonate with a singular music, urgency, and substance.”—Michael Palmer

“McCollough’s Welkin, a revival of those energies which flow between the gorgeous happenstance of Earth and the serene mandates of Heaven. These are poems of a powerfully expressed vertu. These are flowers that know the secrets of their names.” —Donald Revell
