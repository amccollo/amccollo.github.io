“Aaron McCollough’s No Grave Can Hold My Body Down is a bravura experiment in matching literary modernism with the canon of traditional American musics contained in the subtly syncretistic guitar music of the late John Fahey. McCollough aspires to “walk worthy / between the vespers of history,’ and this book is an elaborate preparation for speaking of the relations between World and Wilderness. I admire McCollough’s strategies for marshalling temporally disparate, dissident voices, and for imagining the experience of the newly risen dead.” —David Grubbs
